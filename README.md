Hi there, I’m Jordan Durci (@durcij).  I pop up around the internet as DurchBurch.  I majored in computer science while enrolled in Allegheny College, and have a huge passion for video games.  I was known to make my final projects (where we had the most freedom) into games, from a text-based adventure game (at a rather small scale), to a platformer about tiny characters called the Watchers, to my final project as a student at Allegheny, where I developed a top-down 4-player game with characters inspired by emotions.  I've also been working on developing a creature collecting RPG inspired by both Pokémon and Allegheny College itself.

Lately I've been planning on learning more about how to work with Flexbox in case my friends and I's joke website, [Spaghetti in a Jar](https://www.spaghettiinajar.com) gets commissioned for more jars, as our old implementation will only get more difficult as the number of jars increases.  That said, I've been far more focused on my other work.

My current projects around the internet include [DurchBurch](https://youtube.com/c/DurchBurch) and [Clothing Unrelated](https://clothing-unrelated.creator-spring.com/).

If you need to contact me, you can go to my [website](https://www.durchburch.xyz) which includes links to different ways to contact me.
